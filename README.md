# Title: Show me your plate and I tell you who you are

### Abstract 

The Paper introduces a novel dataset and with it explores the interrelations of nutrion and health. This utilizes the easy association between the Tesco data and aviable census data, which we want to extend on to explore to see if food is a dividing factor or a great unifier in a society.
We propose to combine the data set with aviable census data to explore relationships between socie-economic factors - such as wealth, education, ethnicity and cultural background -, and nutrion.
The association to the Greater London area allows us to explore the inter-relation between nutrion and other census data in a socie-economically diverse metropolitian area.  
This association also allows us to explore geodata based visualization and to make a possibly interactive Map/s of London, that can be explored.

### Research Questions

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

- Who is a Tesco customer, can we find difference in areas were Tesco operates dominantly? 
- Is there a significant difference in nutrients, both individual and in their distribition between different cultural groups? 
- What impact do different socie-economic circumstances have on calories, nutrients and nutrient diversity? 
- Can we train a predictive model that is able to predict socio-economic facts about an area based on nutrion? 
- How does purchase behavior change over the year, is there a change in consumption behavior observable and linkable to different strata

### Proposed dataset

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.

- The [London Data Store](https://data.london.gov.uk/) acts as a Candy Shop, which provides a near infinite supply of possibly interesting data sets, which we could use for our analysis. Some interesting datasets for [LSOA](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/lsoa-atlas), [MSOA](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/msoa-atlas), [Wards](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas), and [Boroughs](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-borough-profiles) feature many important core socio-economic informations about an area, such as Household income, Income Support and JobSeekers Allowance claimant rates, population density, household composition, religion, ethnicity, employment and economic activity, and median area incomes. The data is cleary annotated and after a first inspection seems to be nearly complete, well organised and accessible, although in some instances rather ingranual (The ethic grouping let us suspect the census planners of having a long family history of being let loose with just a ruler on maps). Some issues such as inflation might need to be addressed and some further background research needs to be done, for example how we could discretize certain data based on area population following UK standards, such as for example <i> lower/middle/upper </i> class or the more refined distingiouns made in the [Great British Class Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_British_Class_Survey). The sizes of the dataset don't exceed 6 mb each thus we can easily handle them on our personal ~~lapwarmer~~ laptop. (Bob does not need to fear the bill from the EPFL Computation Cluster). We addionally will crawl further through the aisle of the data store to find additional interesting and even more specific data sets, when we might want to dive deeper into a specific sub-area. 

- To acquiere geodata useable for the timeframe of data collection - census boundries in the UK seem to follow new age trends and are in constant flow - we currently use following [repository](https://github.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON), however we are also searching alternative, possibly more [offical](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/), sources. The Data set is organised based on the Identifiers for the different Census areas, and after filtering out all unnecessary information we are left with around 50 mb of data, from over a Gigabyte for the full UK data set. To make later processing even easier we aim to package it both as .geojson/.json and .pkl files.

Using the former, we already tested it and indeed were able to recreate a London in its natural habitat.

### Methods

To start of we will use the explorative **statitical techniques** covered in the beginning of the lecture to explore and describe the acquiered data. We for example would orient ourselfs on **correlation analysis** and **regression** as already used in the original paper, to discover inter-relationship between nutrients and products and socio-economic factors, such as education, household income, ethnicity and religion. To generate a predictive model, we would consider using a model that were introduced in the lecture and that provide robustness and ease-of-use. In this regard we consider one of the ensemble models, either **boosted trees** or **random forests**. As the data and our proposed goal touch on sensitive topics, we want to also address the issue of the black-box model that arises by using complex ensemble models and explore alternatives that present more transparent results with a more direct interpretability, as such we want to explore the results of **decision trees** and **association rule mining** and compare their interpretability and performance against the former ensemble models.

### Proposed Timeline

- The amuse-bouche: *Setting up the Enviroments and making sure our tools are up-to-date and ready for the tasks*
- The bread and butter: *Data Loading, Cleaning and Pre-Processing*
- The entr√©e: *Analysing the Data based on Correlation and Regression*
- The main dish: *Training a more refined predictive model*
- The side dish: *Finding an explainable model* 
- The dessert: *Making it a coherent data story*
- The cherry on top: *Exploring more advanced visualization of the Data, to allow interactive exploration of the results*

### Organization within the team

The amuse-bouche was pre-prepared by Sous-Chef Luca and Michael. We setup the enviroments we need for processing and later visualization, with an initial struggle. Addionally we acquiered data sets, in this instance GeoJson that we requiere for the later planned visualization.

### Questions for TAs

- Do our semi-serious or humorous texts annoy you or do they lighten up the monotony of looking at 5 times the same project? Should we continue in the more casual style or become more laconic and embrass our inner german-ness? We can stop ... Promise!

- We would like to use a little cross-pollination from the Distributed Information Systems Lecture and utilize some of the there introduced methods, nominally Associations Rule Mining, and would ask if this would be okay?
